# MECCA Mobile Music Platform 

Surprisingly, this works on my flip-phone! Maybe not surprisingly, since KaiOS is basically just a Web engine. Plus there's an actual cursor that you move around, so it's likely better than a touchcreeen because the cusor allows you to preview the note-entry. The only problem was the interface being optimized for desktop, hence this version.

See [https://github.com/porkostomus/mecca-mobile](the original repo) for the original app and details about the MECCA project.
